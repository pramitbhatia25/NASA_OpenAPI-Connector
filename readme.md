## Introduction

This project is an official submission to the Streamlit Connections Hackathon. --> [Link](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/connections-hackathon/47574)

This app demonstrates a connection to the NASA Open API's.

This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to query various NASA APIs to retrieve space-related data. The app currently supports the following NASA APIs:
- Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)
- Mars Rover Photos
- Near-Earth Object Web Service (NEOWS)
- DONKI: Space Weather Database
- Exoplanet Archive

The app provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the APIs and visualize the data returned by NASA. Users can input query parameters, such as dates, to fetch specific data from the APIs.

## Features

- View Astronomy Picture of the Day along with its explanation.
- Explore Mars Rover Photos taken by NASA's rovers on Mars.
- Get information about near-Earth asteroids and comets with the NEOWS API.
- Query the NASA DONKI database for various space weather events and related information.
- Query the Exoplanet Archive database for data on confirmed exoplanets and their hosts.
